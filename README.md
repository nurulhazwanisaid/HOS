Hardware Organizer System (HOS)
This is my internship project, I have developed a system in which it serves a purpose to organize and manage database of
employees' laptops and desktops in the organization. 
This system is built using VB.NET and MySQL with features such as 
add, update, delete, search, and export data to PDF and Excel files. 
This system is still in use by the Company until today.
